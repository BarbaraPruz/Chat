- "Login" as a ChatKit user (no signup yet but that could be added).  There is no current
   authentication.  Just "login" and provide a user id (known to ChatKit for the room)
- Authenticate user (tbd: rails backend with user details?)
- Signup (creates a user on chatkit)
- "Production" - don't use ChatKit test token provider.  Create a token provider.
